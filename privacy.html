            device platform will provide additional tools to allow you to
            control when your device collects or shares particular categories of

        <p>
            We use your personal data in the following ways: To Provide the

            Platform, we will use your personal data to provide the requested
            product or service. For example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com
            or participate in an event or promotion, we will use the contact
            information you give us to communicate with you about the purchase,
            event or promotion. If you contact our consumer services, we will
            use information about you, such as delivery or payment information,
            or the product you have purchased to help you resolve a problem or
            question.<br /><br />

            characteristics, we will collect this personal data and store it so

            may include data you enter about your activity or data collected by
            your device during your activity such as location data and movement
            data. We may use this activity data to calculate further information
            about your activity, such as distance run, or calories burned, so
            that the calculated information can be provided to you as part of
            the functionality of the Platform.<br /><br />

            may need to provide Nike with additional data or additional consent
            to use particular data in a certain way. For example, to use the
            heart rate tracking features of our Platform, you may need to
            connect to a heart rate monitoring device. Similarly, to share
            content on social media, you may be required to provide your social
            media account credentials to sign in.<br /><br />

            about similar Nike products or services where permitted by
            applicable law (unless you have opted-out). In other cases, we ask
            for your consent to send you marketing information. Personalization

            your participation in Nike events and contests - to personalize
            communications on products and services that may be interesting for
            you. In doing so, we may combine the information you provide to us
            with information that we create about your online activity,
            including internal insights and analysis. To Operate, Improve and
            Maintain our Business, Products and Services We use the personal
            data you provide to us to operate our business. For example, when
            you make a purchase, we use that information for accounting, audits
            and other internal functions. We may use personal data about how you
            use our products and services to enhance your user experience and to
